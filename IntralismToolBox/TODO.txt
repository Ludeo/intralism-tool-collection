Try to write a function in Function.cs for loading and saving the config instead of doing that many times in other functions

Config Editor

Multiple Text Sections
- One main
  - Color coded text for each kind of event to help differintiate (allow user to customize colors)
- One for each kind of event (arcs, storyboard, zoom, speed)
- Group Storyboard Events together based on ID (keyframe-inspired style for event editing?)

One Window with tools on a bar or at the top
- More streamlined than the tab format of FRUP's tool

Drag'n'Drop images to automatically add resources
- Or at least find an easier way to add image resources
