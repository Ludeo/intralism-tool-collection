check a player by their rank and not by tiping in a link

optimize update notification (to maybe download it + installer ?)

(maybe a youtube converter with youtube-dl to make getting songs for a new map easier)

add a map creator, that lets you select the icon and music file (and additional stuff like speed) to easier create maps

add a intralism map speed changer

add user statistics in some kind of database -> show a graph of the global and country rank, let the user select a date of the check -> display score 
table

add slider velocity for converting -> base speed = 1 | base speed + 1 = 1.1 (or something like that)

Config Editor

Multiple Text Sections
- One main
  - Color coded text for each kind of event to help differintiate (allow user to customize colors)
- One for each kind of event (arcs, storyboard, zoom, speed)
- Group Storyboard Events together based on ID (keyframe-inspired style for event editing?)

One Window with tools on a bar or at the top
- More streamlined than the tab format of FRUP's tool

Drag'n'Drop images to automatically add resources
- Or at least find an easier way to add image resources
