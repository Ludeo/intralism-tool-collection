If you have c# installed, you can download the c# needed .rar file. If you don't have c# installed, you should download the no c# needed .rar file. Also, if you don't have a ffmpeg.exe file, you should download it as well because otherwise the program won't run. If you downloaded or if you have a ffmpeg.exe file, place it inside the ffmpeg/bin folder.

First of all, you should go into the settings and set the mania song folder path and the intralism editor folder path to make the map conversion easier.

If you want to convert a Mania map to a Intralism map, you have to select the .osu file for the difficulty you want to convert and you have to select the Intralism editor folder which will be the place where the map gets saved. Then you can select the speed that you want for the map and hit the convert button. 

If you want to convert a Intralism map to a mania map, then you have to select the folder of the Intralism map and the osu songs folder. You can also select an offset for the notes since it's a bit off if you just to 1:1 time converts. After that you can just press convert.
