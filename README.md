Collection of tools for Intralism such as Score Checker, Map Converters and Storyboard Helper

# Usage
If you downloaded the version without FFMPEG, make sure that you have the ffmpeg.exe file in the ffmpeg/bin folder, otherwise map convertions won't work.
First of all, you should go into the settings and set the mania song folder path and the intralism editor folder path to make the map converting easier.

If you want to convert a Mania map to a Intralism map, you have to select the .osu file for the difficulty you want to convert and you have to select the Intralism editor folder which will be the place where the map gets saved. Then you can select the speed that you want for the map and hit the convert button. 

If you want to convert a Intralism map to a mania map, then you have to select the folder of the Intralism map and the osu songs folder. You can also select an offset for the notes since it's a bit off if you just to 1:1 time converts. After that you can just press convert.
You can also check scores of a player. For that you paste the profile link of the player (format: https://intralism.khb-soft.ru/?player=PlayerID | replace the player id with the id of the player you want to check) and then hit check to get profile information and the scores information of that player. You can also save players in the player list, to have an easier access to players you want to check more often. You can also press the last checked button to check the last check player again.
